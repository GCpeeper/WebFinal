                <span class="content">
                        <p>I've made my <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144910/?ref=blobfish.dev">first</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1365010/?ref=blobfish.dev">two</a> 
                            commercial games using <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker?ref=blobfish.dev">GameMaker Studio 2</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>I owe a lot to that engine. It helped me get started with gamedev and make a living from it.
                        </p>
                        <p>But for my next projects, I'll be using <a href="https://godotengine.org/?ref=blobfish.dev">Godot</a>. Why is that?</p>

                                <h2><strong>GameMaker's strength</strong></h2>
                                <p>To me, the appeal of GameMaker Studio 2 is in <strong>how easy it is to just put a project together and publish it.</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>You don't have that many things to learn before you can make cool stuff.
                                </p>
                                <p>That's what made me stick with gamedev when working with <a href="https://unity.com/?ref=blobfish.dev">Unity</a> 
                                    was feeling super boring.
                                </p>
                                <p>But it comes at a cost: <strong>you basically have to make everything from scratch.</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>You want smooth camera movement, support for different screen resolutions, localization or a settings menu? Code it yourself.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>It's really good for small games and jams.</strong> But it's harder than it needs to be for bigger commercial games.
                                </p>
                                <h2><strong>Licensing shenanigans</strong></h2>
                                <p>On October 28th, 2021, YoYo Games made a post about a <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/en/blog/gamemaker-version-236?ref=blobfish.dev">new GameMaker Studio 2 update</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>In there they announced that some of the new features would only be available to paying subscribers. Users 
                                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/comments/qhqa05/yoyo_games_has_decided_to_make_some_features/?ref=blobfish.dev">weren't too happy about it</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>There's been a lot of changes since they got <a href="https://press.opera.com/2021/01/20/opera-buys-yoyo-games-gamemaker-opera-gaming/?ref=blobfish.dev">
                                    acquired by Opera</a> earlier this year.
                                </p>
                                <p>Some good: <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/en/blog/gamemaker-update-free-version?ref=blobfish.dev">unlimited free trial</a>, 
                                    <a href="https://press.opera.com/2021/07/22/opera-gx-game-jam/?ref=blobfish.dev">game jams with cash prizes</a>...
                                </p>
                                <p>...and some more controversial: <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/en/blog/more-platforms-for-less?ref=blobfish.dev">
                                    turning the perpetual license into a subscription</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>I don't blame them for renewing their business model and trying out new things. But it does make me a bit worried 
                                    about the future of GameMaker Studio 2.
                                </p>
                                <p>On the other end, Godot is free and open-source.
                                </p>
                                <p>No accounts needed, no licenses, no subscriptions.</p>
                                <p>I once got locked out of GameMaker for a few hours and had to slightly delay an update because there was an issue 
                                    with their registration servers.
                                </p>
                                <p>No chance of that happening with Godot. It's just simpler.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Why Godot over Unity</strong></h2>
                                <p>I actually have more experience with Unity than Godot.</p>
                                <p>I made a small game called <a href="https://thomasgvd.itch.io/potato-tactics?ref=blobfish.dev">Potato Tactics</a> 
                                    with it and used it professionally as a tool programmer for a bit over 3 months.
                                </p>
                                <p>It's popular, big and powerful. But I just don't like working with it.</p>
                                <p>It feels unintuitive to me, it takes forever to load, you still have to manage accounts and licenses and there's a 
                                    ton of features, plugins and assets all over the place.
                                </p>
                                <p>On the other hand, Godot is a very minimalistic engine.</p>
                                <p>You can just download a 50mb .exe file and get started working right away.</p>
                                <p>I see it as a bit of a mix between GameMaker and Unity.</p>
                                <p>It's small and slick but also gives you some advanced functionalities like editor tools and 3D support with 
                                    none of the fluff.
                                </p>
                                <p>The engine is still in its infancy but I think it has a bright future. It feels like the perfect step-up from GameMaker.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Godot's downsides</strong></h2>
                                <p>With all of that said, I can still see some downsides to Godot:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>The learning curve is steeper than GameMaker's</strong>. There are more features to learn and you have to know more about programming to use it properly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>It seems harder to port to consoles</strong>. I haven't looked much into it yet but its open-source nature forbids it from having native export buttons to consoles. Meaning we probably have to go through a third party company to do it for us? Not sure.</li>
                                    <li><strong>There are fewer tutorials and courses to learn it.</strong> It can be hard to find answers to very specific questions about the engine on Google.</li>
                                    <li><strong>There are basically no Godot jobs available </strong>in the industry right now because it's so new and targeted at smaller teams. If you want to find a game programming job, you should learn Unity or Unreal instead. GameMaker shares the same downside.</li>
                                    <li><strong>The 3D support seems lacking right now. </strong>It should be fixed when Godot 4.0 comes out sometime in 2022 though, and it's still better than GameMaker in that regard anyway.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>To me, the advantages far outweigh the downsides.</p>
                                <h2><strong>My plan moving forward</strong></h2>
                                <p>At this point, I've been learning Godot for a few weeks.</p>
                                <p>It's been a bit all over the place and my learning process has been far from optimal.</p>
                                <p>I've been following a bunch of courses and tutorials haphazardly without having much to show for it. <em>(more on that later)</em></p>
                                <p>So from now on, I'll try to heed my own advice and learn by <strong>completing and publishing a lot of small projects.</strong></p>
                                <p>I'll share my progress, lessons learned and the things I make in these articles.</p>
                                <p>I hope that following along my journey of learning a new engine from scratch to eventually publishing a new commercial game will help 
                                    and inspire you to see your own projects through to completion.</p>
