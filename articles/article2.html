                <span class="content">
                    <p>While working on my first game 
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144910/Space_Gladiators/?ref=blobfish.dev">Space Gladiators</a>
                     in 2019, I decided to start sharing some gamedev related
                     ideas every week in a newsletter.</p>
                    <p>Most of those were only read by a dozen people and the
                     emails have been sitting on my Google Drive since then.</p>
                    <p>I still think most of those ideas are relevant. So I
                     went through all of them, removed and updated some and
                     compiled everything in today's post.
                     <br><br>
                     None of these are hard and fast truths, just ideas I got
                     and observations I made while working on my action roguelite
                     game. Enjoy!</p>
                    <h2>Be careful which game you're comparing yours to</h2>
                    <p>If you’re making a tiny roguelite and tell them “it’s
                     influenced by
                      <a href="https://dead-cells.com/?ref=blobfish.dev">Dead Cells</a>”,
                     they’ll start with very high expectations.
                     <br><br>
                     They’ll probably end up disappointed when they find out it’s not as 
                     good as Dead Cells.
                     <br><br>
                     Some of them might even get offended that you’re comparing it to a
                      game they love.
                    <br><br>
                    A recent example: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/?ref=blobfish.dev">Back 4 Blood</a>
                     being constantly compared to the 
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/?ref=blobfish.dev">Left 4 Dead</a>
                     franchise means 
                     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdRLNUGmFC8&amp;ref=blobfish.dev">players were disappointed</a>
                     when they found out it's not as good.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Marketing is about getting strangers to trust you</h2>
                    <p>Players need to trust that they’ll have fun with your game.
                    <br><br>
                        Recommendations from friends or influencers are powerful 
                        because they basically circumvent the process.
                        <br><br>
                        Players will instantly trust your game as much as they 
                        trust the person recommending it.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Your players can put up with a lot if they enjoy your game</h2>
                    <p>It means you don’t necessarily have to fix every bug and issue 
                        before showing it… or even releasing it.
                        <br><br>
                        I know that because I’ve been playing 
                        <a href="https://www.dofus.com/?ref=blobfish.dev">Dofus</a> 
                        on and off these last years, a game that’s been out for more 
                        than 15 years.
                        <br><br>
                        There are so many broken things in the game: music tracks 
                        that play when they shouldn’t (and disabling them works only half the time), 
                        memory leaks that force you to restart the game every hour 
                        or so, missing animations, an unbalanced matchmaking system…
                        <br><br>
                        But it’s still a very successful game with hundreds of 
                        thousands of players.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Working hard on a game doesn’t mean it’ll be successful</h2>
                    <p>You could make 1% of someone else’s effort and get better 
                        results than them.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/657000/Rising_Hell/?ref=blobfish.dev">Rising Hell</a> 
                        development has started more than <strong>4 years</strong> 
                        ago and it’s made by <strong>5 people</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1267810/Gutwhale/?ref=blobfish.dev">Gutwhale</a> 
                        was made in <strong>1 month</strong> by <strong>3 people</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        Now compare the number of reviews they each have: <strong>156 </strong>
                        and <strong>113</strong>. (at the time I’m writing this)
                        <br><br>
                        Gutwhale did sell less and at a lower price than Rising Hell, 
                        though not by that much.
                        <br><br>
                        But there's a massive difference in the effort that was necessary 
                        to produce the games.
                        <br><br>
                        It's even more blatant if you look at games like 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/915310/SNKRX/?ref=blobfish.dev">SNKRX</a>. 
                        (1 person, 3 months, 3302 reviews)
                    </p>
                    <h2>Your feelings towards your game will fluctuate</h2>
                    <p>One day you’ll think it’s a piece of crap and that it’ll never 
                        be successful.
                        <br><br>
                        The next day you’ll think it’s the best thing ever.
                        <br><br>
                        What matters - if you want to actually finish games - is that 
                        you don’t completely mentally give up on it during your off days.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Be careful about your expectations as a solo dev</h2>
                    <p>If you’re a solo dev, you’re competing with games made by 
                        dozens of people. 
                        <br><br>
                        Even if you consider only very small teams of 2 or 3 devs, 
                        it still means that you’ll theoretically have to spend 
                        twice or thrice the time to make the same thing.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1037020/ScourgeBringer/?ref=blobfish.dev">Scourgebringer</a>. 
                        Very small scope, but as far as I know it was made by 2 devs 
                        full time during 2 years.
                        <br><br>
                        So you should be prepared to spend 3-4 years to develop something 
                        of a similar quality. Even worse if you’re doing it in your free 
                        time. 
                        <br><br>
                        And that’s not even considering that they’re experienced devs who 
                        already released 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400450/NeuroVoider/?ref=blobfish.dev">a game in the same genre</a> 
                        before.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Your work compounds</h2>
                    <p>In the beginning, you have to put in a lot of effort for very little 
                        results. 
                        <br><br>
                        You have to build all the back-end of your game while it’s not 
                        even playable yet.
                        <br><br>
                        You post a YouTube video and you get 10 views.
                        <br><br>
                        But it gets easier and easier over time. 
                        <br><br>
                        The exact same video that took you the exact same amount of effort 
                        to craft might bring you 5x, 10x or even 100x the results as your 
                        audience grows.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Contacting YouTubers: bigger is not always better</h2>
                    <p>Things to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some of them have a lot of subscribers but a very tiny view and engagement count. (<strong>bad</strong>)</li>
                        <li>Are they focusing on games in the same genre as yours (<strong>good</strong>) or do they cover a broad range of unrelated games (<strong>bad</strong>)?</li>
                        <li>Are people watching these videos only for the host personality (<strong>bad</strong>) or to look for games to play (<strong>good</strong>)?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Do note that I’m not saying channels centered around their host are bad. 
                        <br><br>
                        I’m just pointing out factors that have an impact on what kind of 
                        exposure and financial results you can expect from working with them.
                        <br><br>
                        If a creator posts only no commentary gameplay videos and still gets a 
                        lot of engagement, <strong>you know</strong> those people are here for 
                        the game.<br><br>All of this to say: <strong>don’t overlook small 
                        channels that have a targeted audience. </strong>
                        <br><br>
                        A channel with a qualified audience of 6K can generate more sales 
                        than one with 250K subscribers. (happened to me)
                    </p>
                    <h2>Your game doesn't have to be a masterpiece</h2>
                    <p>A game doesn’t have to be a masterpiece to make players happy.
                        <br><br>
                        People can look over balancing issues, ugly NPCs or stiff animations 
                        if they enjoy the core loop of the game.
                        <br><br>
                        Don’t wait for perfection before sharing your work.
                        <br><br>
                        You’re probably not going to be the next Minecraft or Dead Cells 
                        or Hollow Knight.
                    </p>
                    <p>But if your goal is live off your games, <strong>you don’t need to</strong>. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thousands of indie devs are earning a (good) living with games you’ve 
                        never heard of.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The longer you work on a game, the more pressure you’ll feel</h2>
                    <p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your game will need to bring in more money for you to consider it a success.</li>
                        <li>You’ll be more likely to burnout. Which will make you less productive and motivated.</li>
                        <li>You’ll have more chance of getting caught in a <a href="https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/deathloops.html?ref=blobfish.dev">death loop</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can avoid a whole lot of issues if you keep your scope small.</p>
                    <h2>Every platform is just trying to win</h2>
                    <p>For Twitter, it means putting forward the tweets that get the
                         most engagement.<br><br>For Steam, it means showcasing the games 
                        that are proven to convert visitors to sales.
                        <br><br>
                        For YouTubers, it means playing the games that generate the most 
                        views.
                        <br><br>
                        What does it mean for you?
                        <br><br>
                        The more successful your game is, the more successful it’ll become. 
                        <br><br>
                        But the opposite is also true. 
                        <br><br>
                        If your game is unknown and hasn’t proven its worth, very few people 
                        and platforms will take the risk of showcasing it when they have 
                        hundreds of other games that have a proven track record.

                    <h2>Know your audience</h2>
                    <p>You have to know who your game is for and tailor the experience to 
                        what they like.
                        <br><br>
                        For example: if you’re making a gameplay focused roguelike like 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne?ref=blobfish.dev">Nuclear Throne</a>, 
                        keep the text to a minimum. 
                        <br><br>
                        People who play these kinds of games want action fast and will likely skip 
                        most of the texts.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Make sure your game hits the key beats of your genre</h2>
                    <p>When looking at games of the same genre, you can notice they all have 
                        features that are different on the surface but actually serve the same 
                        purpose.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, in the roguelite 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/?ref=blobfish.dev">Slay the Spire</a> 
                        the cards give a sense of diversity and control over your overall strategy.
                        <br><br>
                        This same purpose is being filled by items in 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/?ref=blobfish.dev">The Binding of Isaac</a> 
                        or weapons in 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?ref=blobfish.dev">Dead Cells</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        Every roguelite punctuates their runs with mid-journey big challenges you 
                        have to prepare for, such as Elites in Slay the Spire or bosses in 
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1108370/Ratropolis/?ref=blobfish.dev">Ratropolis</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        You should make sure your game hits all the same key ideas as successful 
                        games in your genre but in your own specific ways.</p>
                        <h2>Look at what people do, not what they say</h2>
                        <p>If they tell you your game is great but they play it only for an hour 
                            and never get back into it, it means you still have work to do.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The biggest obstacle you'll face as a new dev</h2>
                        <p>When you’re starting out, the biggest obstacle you’ll face is 
                            <strong>not</strong> that people won’t like your game.
                            <br><br>
                            It’s that no one will know or care about it.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Know the focus of your game</h2>
                        <p>Always prioritize it when you have to make a decision. 
                            <br><br>
                            I’m making a roguelite, so gameplay is my focus. Here’s an example 
                            of how that idea influenced my decision.
                            <br><br>
                            When my characters use a shield, they hold it up in front of them. 
                            <br><br>
                            So it protects them from the front. Makes sense, right? 
                            <br><br>
                            The problem is that no one uses them because they kind of suck 
                            compared to other items.
                            <br><br>
                            Having to turn the right way to protect yourself is too much of a hassle.
                            <br><br>
                            So I instead just made the player invulnerable from all sides. 
                            <br><br>
                            It’s not logical and look less realistic, but it’s better gameplay-wise.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Make your game technically unfair to the player</h2>
                        <p>If you want your game to feel fair to the player, it has to be 
                            technically unfair.
                            <br><br>
                            The games that feel good to play implement a lot of different 
                            tactics that give leeway to the player. (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattThorson/status/1238338574220546049?ref=blobfish.dev">see this twitter thread</a> from Matt Thorson, creator of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/?ref=blobfish.dev">Celeste</a>)
                            <br><br>
                            Allow them to jump out of a platform even if they’ve already started 
                            falling from it.
                            <br><br>
                            Push them up a tiny bit if they tried to dash somewhere but bumped their 
                            feet on the wall.
                            <br><br>
                            Make the enemy hitboxes smaller or turn them for free when they’re hitting 
                            in the wrong direction - 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtBNffzWhf4&amp;ref=blobfish.dev">like Dead Cells does</a>.
                            <br><br>
                            Try to understand what the player wants to do and help them out. 
                            <br><br>
                            If you don’t do it, your game will feel frustrating - even though it’ll 
                            technically be fair.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Players care about how a game makes them feel</h2>
                        <p>Most of them don't care that much about technicalities.
                            <br><br>
                            Your game might have 300 items, a dozen of worlds and hours of gameplay. 
                            <br><br>
                            But it might still be less appealing and less successful than a 
                            15mn game with no content but perfect character control.
                            <br><br>
                            Most people will only play your game for a few dozen minutes 
                            before deciding whether they like it or not anyway.

And most games that do get finished don’t make any money.<br><br>We only ever hear about the successful ones and it gives us a biased perspective on the market.</p><h2 id="but-most-people-arent-trying-that-hard">...but most people aren't trying that hard</h2><p>Most people are not that dedicated to making a financially successful game.<br><br>If you’re:</p><ol><li>Seeing your project through to the end and not giving up,</li><li>Putting effort into polishing it,</li><li>Committed to improving your skills,</li><li>Listening to your players to iterate on your ideas,</li><li>And understanding where your game fits on the market...</li></ol><p>I believe you’re actually ahead of 99% of other projects already and you’re only competing with a fraction of them.</p><h2 id="using-willpower-doesnt-work-in-the-long-run">Using willpower doesn't work in the long run</h2><p>Instead, change up your environment so you don’t have to use any willpower.</p><h2 id="polishing-a-game-takes-as-much-time-as-making-it">Polishing a game takes as much time as making it</h2><p>At some point during development, your game will look like it’s done. <br><br>The main systems will be in place. The graphics will look almost finalized. <br><br>That’s when you’ll think you’re 90% done - when you’re actually only halfway there.<br><br>Polishing a game takes at least as much time as making it in the first place.</p><h2 id="compare-your-work-over-longer-periods-to-see-your-progress">Compare your work over longer periods to see your progress</h2><p>When doing something every day, you don’t really notice your progress. <br><br>But compare your current work to what you were doing a year ago and you’ll see how much you’ve improved. <br><br>That became really clear to me when I redesigned a bunch of enemies I had made when first starting out.<br><br>It’s always a good thing to look at when you feel like you’re just treading water.</p><h2 id="being-too-dependent-on-specific-tools-can-be-dangerous">Being too dependent on specific tools can be dangerous</h2><p>It’s dangerous to be entirely dependent on specific tools if you want to build a sustainable business.<br><br>I’m using the Gamemaker Studio 2 engine. Due to server issues on their side, a lot of users could not log into their account for the past 3 days.<br><br>Which means they <strong>could not access their project</strong> and <strong>could not work</strong> at all during that time. <br><br>It’s the same thing if you’re basing your whole business on one platform: YouTube, Steam, Twitter… any of those companies could decide from one day to the next to delete your stuff. <br><br>Ideally, you should structure your business so that any one platform / person / company <strong>should not be able to destroy it</strong> if they just decide to.</p><h2 id="do-you-like-game-dev-or-just-the-idea-of-doing-it">Do you like game dev or just the idea of doing it?</h2><p>Should you try to make a career out of indie game development?<br><br>There’s an important distinction to make here. <br><br>Do you like the <strong>idea</strong> of being an indie dev or do you like <strong>actually doing it</strong>?<br><br>Personally, I like the idea of being an artificial intelligence (AI) researcher and professor. <br><br>I think it’s an important field for the future and I’d surely enjoy the status and prestige it gives.<br><br>When it comes to actually studying AI though, <strong>I’m bored out of my mind</strong>. So I’m not pursuing that as a career.<br><br>I don’t think indie dev is particularly prestigious. A lot of people see you as a kid playing games. <br><br>But I (mostly) enjoy doing it day to day. I’m excited to see my projects come to life and I love watching people play my games.<br><br>Basically, what I’m trying to say is: <strong>ask yourself if you’re doing it for the right reasons. </strong><br><br>Are you excited about <strong>making </strong>games? <br><br>Or are you excited about <strong>telling people</strong> you’re a game developer?</p><h2 id="making-a-game-is-a-mix-of-fun-and-boring-work">Making a game is a mix of fun and boring work</h2><p>Fun:</p><ul><li>Coming up with ideas and concepts</li><li>Designing the game</li><li>Coding the initial main systems</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>Boring:</p><ul><li>Adding content (depending on your interests)</li><li>Polishing stuff</li><li>Fixing bugs &amp; glitches</li><li>Menus &amp; UI</li><li>Managing different input devices and resolutions</li><li>Remapping controls</li><li>Localization</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>I believe a big reason why people love doing gamejams is that you only have to make the fun parts of a game before moving on.<br><br>But you need to be able to do the boring work if you want to publish a commercial game.</p><h2 id="finishing-your-projects-is-hard">Finishing your projects is hard</h2><p>As an indie game developer, I believe the hardest and most important skill to acquire is to finish a project even after you’ve lost interest in it.<br><br>Especially when you realize no one really cares if you complete your game or not. <br><br>You have no deadlines. No boss. No pressure. Only self-motivation.<br><br>Just by finishing a game, you’re ahead of most people who want to get into that field.<br><br>You should be proud of yourself whether or not it brings you the external success you wished for.</p><h2 id="getting-an-idea-is-easy-implementing-it-is-hard">Getting an idea is easy, implementing it is hard</h2><p>When making a game, the “creativity” part only represents a fraction of the project. <br>Getting a good idea takes a few minutes, implementing it can take days.</p><h2 id="being-a-good-programmer-being-a-good-solo-dev">Being a good programmer =/= being a good solo dev</h2><p>The difficulty of making a financially successful indie game on your own doesn’t usually come from hard technical challenges.<br><br>You’ll more likely struggle in:</p><ul><li>The <strong>project management</strong> aspects (hitting deadlines, motivation, discipline, time management, finances…)</li><li>The sheer<strong> amount of content</strong> you have to create</li><li>The amount of<strong> different skills</strong> you have to learn and be good at</li><li>The <strong>business and marketing </strong>aspects (letting people know your game exists and making them care)</li><li>… and putting it all together to make a <strong>good polished game</strong> that actually has a place in the market.</li></ul><p>It’s why being an excellent programmer doesn’t automatically translate to being an excellent indie developer.</p><h2 id="always-pick-the-simplest-option">Always pick the simplest option</h2><p>When having to choose between multiple options (engines, ideas, languages…), always pick the simpler one. <br><br>Bringing a game to life is difficult enough that you should reduce complexity where you can.<br><br>This is one of the reasons why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apfNODay1_s&amp;ref=blobfish.dev">Rogue Legacy could be made in only 1 year and a half</a>.</p><h2 id="a-small-motivation-tip">A small motivation tip</h2><p>Do the hard parts of your work when you’re feeling motivated and energized. <br><br>Do the easy and exciting parts when you’re having a rough day.</p><h2 id="dont-tackle-too-many-challenges-at-once">Don't tackle too many challenges at once</h2><p>Say you have no experience in game development. <br><br>You don’t have an artistic background, you don’t know how to code and you never played an instrument in your life.<br><br>If you start out by trying to create a MMORPG in a game engine you know nothing about… <br><br>You’ll almost certainly become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information you have to learn to keep moving forward.<br><br>Every time you start a new project, pick only one or two new things to learn.</p><h2 id="making-a-game-is-similar-to-playing-a-mmorpg">Making a game is similar to playing a MMORPG</h2><p>You’re making a plan on what you want to accomplish. Then you’re grinding to make it happen.<br><br>The difference is that it’s a lot easier in a game than in real life.<br><br>Because a game designer is making sure you’re getting rewarded exactly at the right times to feel like you’re progressing.<br><br>In your work, you might go through days and weeks of efforts without rewards.<br><br>But once they come (as praise, sales or simply players enjoying your game), they’re a lot more meaningful and satisfying than the former.</p><h2 id="discipline-is-not-a-personality-trait">Discipline is not a personality trait</h2><p>It’s mostly just dependent on your environment.<br><br>If you have:</p><ul><li>A laggy computer,</li><li>People watching Netflix around you all the time</li><li>And friends constantly pinging you to join them in the latest MMORPG...</li></ul><p>Then it’s only a matter of time before you stop working on your game.<br><br>But if you:</p><ul><li>Have a great computer,</li><li>Live with people that are working on their own projects,</li><li>And you’re running out of cash to put food on the table…</li></ul><p>Working on your project will be a piece of cake.</p><h2 id="constraints-foster-productivity">Constraints foster productivity</h2><p>If you just set out to <em>“make a game”</em>, you will likely waste a lot of time contemplating all the different options and things you could do.<br><br>Instead, you could decide to make a 10 minutes long 2D platformer using <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker?ref=blobfish.dev">GameMaker Studio 2</a> that’ll get published on <a href="https://itch.io/?ref=blobfish.dev">itch.io</a> in 2 weeks.<br><br>That would make it much easier to know what you have to do now in order to move forward.</p><h2 id="reduce-your-workload-where-you-can">Reduce your workload where you can</h2><p>Not all work is created equal.<br><br>You might think it looks cool to have 15 frames idle animations instead of 6 frames for your NPCs. <br><br>But the players don’t care that much and you’ll waste hours that could have been better spent.</p><h2 id="the-bigger-your-project-becomes-the-harder-it%E2%80%99ll-be-to-work-with-it">The bigger your project becomes, the harder it’ll be to work with it</h2><p>Tracking down bugs gets more difficult. Compiling takes more time. <br><br>Overall, a lot of things become slower and more annoying to do.</p><h2 id="your-resources-are-limited">Your resources are limited</h2><p>Every functionality you choose to add into your game comes at the expense of something else.<br><br>Say you’re spending a week crafting beautiful menus while your players are asking you to fix game-breaking bugs or to add new enemies.<br><br>Even though your game might become 1% better because of those menus, it could have become 20% more fun in the same time frame had you worked on the latter issues instead.<br><br>Anyone could make a successful game with unlimited time, resources and feedback. But no one actually has that.<br><br>The real challenge of gamedev is knowing where to spend your energy and what you should disregard completely.</p>
